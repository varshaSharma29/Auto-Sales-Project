# Auto Sales Data Analysis Project:
A comprehensive analysis of auto sales data, encompassing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and market dynamics.

Data Cleaning:

1. Handling missing values: Identifying and imputing missing values in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
2. Data normalization: Standardizing data formats and scales to facilitate analysis.
3. Error detection and correction: Identifying and correcting errors in the data, such as inconsistencies in vehicle models or pricing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. Summary statistics: Calculating descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to understand the distribution of key variables.
2. Correlation analysis: Examining relationships between variables, such as the correlation between vehicle price and sales volume.
3. Distribution analysis: Visualizing the distribution of variables, such as sales by region or vehicle type.

Data Visualization:

1. Sales trends: Visualizing sales data over time to identify patterns, seasonality, and trends.
2. Vehicle popularity: Analyzing sales data by vehicle make, model, and type to determine popular models and trends.
3. Regional analysis: Visualizing sales data by region to identify geographic trends and patterns.
4. Customer behavior: Analyzing customer demographics, such as age and income, to understand purchasing behavior.

Key Insights:

1. Sales trends: Identifying seasonal fluctuations, growth patterns, or declines in sales.
2. Vehicle popularity: Determining the most popular vehicle types.
3. Regional variations: Understanding geographic differences in sales patterns and customer behavior.
4. Customer behavior: Gaining insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
